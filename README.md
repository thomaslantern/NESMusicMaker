# NESMusicMaker
<h1>Let's Make Music Together!</h1>
This is my JS app to create an .NES cartridge that plays a short sample of music. Choose the notes you want on the music staff, then click on "download cartridge" to download an .NES cartridge that contains your little song snippet.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Q: What's with the birthday wish when I play the NES cartridge?</h3>
Well, first of all it's probably not my birthday (most of the time it isn't). But yes, the graphics are a holdover from a school project that I made this for. In future versions you won't see them, so if you're not reading this right now, don't worry about it! (And if you are reading this, please be patient - I'll add little updates everyday until this is fixed.)

<h3>Q: Is there anything else I should keep in mind when using this app?</h3>

Rests don't work, so I've disabled them for now. Also, if you play the same note twice it just doubles the note length; this is because the note being played is basically just a straight sine wave, so there's no attack/release/decay on the note, like there would be with an actual musical instrument... so you can't hear where one note ends and the next begins, if they're the same note. This is something I will fix soon!
